    Notes: 

    MaxIm camera, guide camera, and telescope must be set up properly

    Even so, the first time this is run, keep an eye out for MaxIm
    dialogs, as this program will hang until they are answered.  To
    fix this, a wathdog timer would need to be used.

    Technical note for downstream object use: we don't have access to
    the MaxIm CCDCamera.ImageArray, but we do have access to similar
    information (and FITS keys) in the Document object.  The CCDCamera
    object is linked to the actual last image read, where the Document
    object is linked to the currently active window.  This means the
    calling routine could potentially expect the last image read in
    but instead get the image currently under focus by the user.  The
    solution to this is to (carefully) use notify events to interrupt
    MaxIm precisely when the event you expect happens (e.g. exposure
    or guide image acuired).  Then you are sure the Document object
    has the info you expect.  Beware that while you have control,
    MaxIm is stuck and bad things may happen, like the guider might
    get lost, etc.  If your program is going to take a long time to
    work with the information it just got, figure out a way to do so

    def guider_motor_reverse_setup(self):
        """Set up property for guiding and moving the telescope with guider
        slews.

        Details: Set up property so guiding works regardless of
        whether or not MaxIm is connected to the telescope and
        regardless of how the guider was calibrated.  Also set up
        property so we can use use MaxIm's control of the guider
        inputs of the mount to do small motions to center our target.

        To briefly review how autoguiding works, MaxIm measures the
        current X and Y position of the guide star and calculates
        the number of pixels it needs to move to get to the desired
        guide position.  Of course, MaxIm doesn't physically move
        pixels in the camera, it moves the telescope.  So there
        needs to be some sort of calibration that goes between the
        two.  GuiderXSpeed, GuiderYSpeed, and GuiderAngle is that
        calibration.

        MaxIm calibrates the guider by finding the brightest star in
        the FOV.  The +X and +Y buttons are operated such that the
        star is moved in an "L" shape.  First in the +-X direction
        and then in the +/-Y direction.  It is up to the user to
        connect the X and Y leads that MaxIm is operating to the RA
        and DEC leads of the mount.  Generally +X is considered +RA,
        which is E, or *left* as you look at the sky with no camera
        mirroring or rotation effects and the +Y lead is north.
        Because it is the mount that moves E and N, the star, which
        is fixed on the sky, appears to move W and S.  MaxIm, of
        course, knows this and applies the appropriate minus sign
        when calculating the GuiderXSpeed and GuiderYSpeed
        quantities.  These are the speed in guider camera pixels per
        second the mount moves when X and Y are pressed.  Note some
        confusion may arise because MaxIm pixel coordinates (0,0)
        are at the *top* left of the image, which is the up/down
        mirror from normal Cartesian coordinates.  Thus, if N is up
        as displayed by MaxIm, +N ends up being -Y in MaxIm
        GuiderYSpeed.  A final quantity is necessary: GuiderAngle,
        the angle CCW from N of the +Y telescope motion direction.

        Whew!

        Now add the complication of a GEM.

        A GEM effectively operates in two modes because it has to
        carry the telescope on one side or the other of the pier to
        be able to view all of the sky
        https://ascom-standards.org/Help/Platform/html/P_ASCOM_DeviceInterface_ITelescopeV3_SideOfPier.htm
        has a discussion of how this is somewhat awkwardly
        implemented in ASCOM.  Add to this the complication that
        different GEM mounts do different things to their coordinate
        systems when the mount is on the two different sides.  RA is
        generally left alone, since on either side of the pier, the
        RA axis still has to rotate toward the west.  But DEC
        conventions vary.  When the mount flips and points the
        telscope at the same place on the sky (issues of
        counterweight up aside), RA flips 180 and DEC flips 180,
        resulting in the telescope tube *rotating* 180.  Some
        mounts, like my Astro-Physics 1100, leave the DEC motors
        connected in the same sense on both sides of the mount.
        This results in somewhat counter-intuitive behavior of the
        telescope tube when you press N.  When near the equator, on
        one side of the mount (ASCOM pierWest, looking east), N
        moves you torward N, on the other (e.g. when I am in Park
        4), it moves you toward S.  Other mounts (Paramount, I
        think) define the preferred N goes N side as ASCOM pierEast.
        Still other mounts (PlaneWave, I think) flip N and S when
        you flip the mount, so N always moves the tube N.

        No matter what the mount does with N/S, one thing never
        changes on pier flip: the tube rotates 180 degrees such that
        if N was up before, it is now down.  And if E was left in
        the camera, it is now right.  When doing absolute
        astrometry, this matters a lot, but when guiding, it gets a
        little simpler.  On mounts that don't reverse the N/S motor
        sense on flip (e.g. Astro-Physics, Paramount), because both
        astrometric N/S and motion N/S have flipped, the guider can
        blithly press the same N or S button to get the star to move
        the expected direction in camera Y coordinates.  X is not so
        lucky.  RA has really flipped in the camera but not on the
        mount.  Someone needs to keep track of that flip.  As
        described below, MaxIm has that capacity both for
        interactive and scripted use.
        
        For interactive use, MaxIm uses the Pier Flip box in the
        Camera->Guide tab together with the Guider Motor Control On
        Pier Flip radio buttons in the Guide -> Settings -> Advanced
        tab to let the user fix guider pier flip issues.  These
        controls tell MaxIm to swap the RA and/or DEC connections on
        pier flip.  For mounts that properly report their pier flip
        state via ASCOM, the Auto Pier Flip box can be checked,
        which basically keeps track of checking the Pier Flip box
        for you.  For scripting use, the GuiderReverseX and
        GuiderReverseY property can be used.  More on those later.

        The problem with the "Pier Flip" nomenclature is, of course,
        that it is not absolute.  "Pier Flip" relative to what?  At
        some level it doesn't matter.  If you calibrated the guider on
        one side of the pier and then do a pier flip, then you need to
        tell the guider you have pier flipped.  Fiddle with the Pier
        Flip radio buttons in the Guider Settings Advanced tab until
        guiding works and you are done.  This also works for
        AutoPierFlip, but it happens to have an absolute:

        MaxIm "Pier Flip" is ASCOM pierWest looking east (through the
        pole).  MaxIm normal (no pier flip) is pierEast looking west

        So if your mount reports its pierside state properly via
        ASCOM, it is probably best to do your first guider
        calibration on pierEast looking west (normal).  Then enable
        MaxIm's AutoPierFlip, do a pier flip, guide, and poke the
        radio buttons in Guider Settings Advanced until guiding
        works.  Once you have those radio buttons set, you can
        recalibrate the guider on any side of the mount because
        MaxIm will automatically reverse the motor connections as
        per your specifications as it is doing the calibration.
        Sure you will get GuiderAngle of +180 on opposite sides of
        the mount, but if you take that into consideration with the
        guider speeds, everything will end up looking like it is
        calibrated relative to the normal ASCOM pointing state.

        Whew!

        Now enter ACP.  

        It is not clearly stated why but
        http://acp.dc3.com/RotatedGuiding.pdf explains that ACP has
        chosen the opposite of the mount from MaxIm to act as the
        guider calibration standard.  ACP users are instructed to
        put the mount on pierWest looking east, turn AutoPierFlip
        off, and calibrate.  This is unfortunate, since it
        completely breaks MaxIm guiding.  Furthermore, MaxIM
        profiles can't be used to fully change between ACP guiding
        mode and MaxIm guiding mode since the profile doesn't
        preserve the AutoPierFlip state button state.

        Since the ACP rotated guiding document states that the ACP
        pierWest guider calibration standard is not going to change,
        we need to deal with it here.  We also want to make it
        convenient to be used in normal MaxIm mode.  Fortunately, we
        can use the hints summarized below to let us figure out which
        mode we are in.  We can then use the GuiderReverseX and
        GuiderReverseY property to manually reverse the sense of the
        guider motor conenctions.

        Before describing how we can figure out what side of the mount
        the guider was calibrated on and what mode of guiding we are
        in, we need to describe the other thing we do with this
        software: move the mount so that in the main camera, our
        target is centered where we want it.  The main camera pixel
        coordinates of these quantities are stored in the obj_center
        and desired_center property of the ObsData object or its
        subclass (e.g. CorObsData).  Using the main camera PinPoint
        sample astrometry solution, run_level_main_astrometry, we can
        translate these pixel coordinates into absolute astrometric
        coordinates and figure out how far to move the mount to get
        our target centered.  

        There are several ways we can move the mount: enter in new
        coordinates, push mount motion buttons with ASCOM direct, or
        push mount motion buttons with whatever MaxIm uses for the
        guider.  Since we the user has already figured out how to
        connect MaxIm to the mount to make the guider work and there
        is an easy way to command MaxIm to use that connection via the
        scripting interface (CCDCamera.GuiderMove()), we will do the
        later.  The problem with this is that motor reverse commands
        effect these motor control commands.  So if we want to move
        the telescope in astrometric coordinate space, we need to keep
        track of the motor flips and undo them when.  --> Alternately,
        we could translate our astrometric coordinates into guider
        pixel space, apply a guider speed and angle coordinate
        translation and the flips would take care of themselves.

        Whew!

        Now we can write down the various cases of what mode we are
        in, how the guider was calibrated, how pier flipping is
        tracked and how we need to track that pier flipping to reverse
        its effect when we want to use the MaxIm guider motion commands.

        (1) MaxIm guiding mode:
            Telescope connected to MaxIm
            AutoPierFlip enabled
            if cal pierEast, directions match astrometry rotated to pierEast
            [Guider motor connections can be grepped in this configuration]
            if cal pierWest, E/W and/or N/S will be flipped,
                depending on Guider Motor Control state
            MaxIm will manage all pier flip for the guider
            Observing pierWest, unflip E/W and/or N/S for guider moves

        (1a) MaxIm guiding mode but scope not connected for some reason
             We have to manage all pier flip stuff for the guider via
             GuiderReverseX and GuiderReverseY
             Observing pierWest, unflip E/W and/or N/S for guider moves

        (2) ACP guiding mode:
            telescope should not be connected
            AutoPierFlip probably disabled
            Astrometry directions flipped to pierWest should match
                guider cal directions
            We have to manage all pier flip stuff for the guider via
            GuiderReverseX and GuiderReverseY
            Observing pierEast, unflip E/W and/or N/S for guider moves

        The MaxIm scripting interface does not provide any property
        for the Guider Motor Control radio buttons, so we duplicate
        them here as global variables
        (guider_motor_control_reverse[XY]), though there is one case
        when we can grep them out of the guider cal.  If this gets
        closely integrated with ACP, we might also be able to get
        these from its configuration options.
